# 🐍 PYTHON CODING TEST — CLASSES, INHERITANCE & DATA STRUCTURES

## 📘 Overview
This project contains a collection of Python classes, inheritance  programs demonstrating **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as **classes, inheritance, and encapsulation**, as well as the use of **Python data structures** (lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples).

Each exercise focuses on a specific OOP or data structure concept — useful for learning, testing, or interview preparation.

## 🧱 Topics Covered

### 🔹 1. Classes and Objects
- **BankAccount** — basic deposit, withdrawal, and balance check.
- **Student** — store subjects and marks, find the highest score.
- **Playlist** — manage a list of songs with add, remove, and shuffle.
- **HistoryTracker** — track user actions using a list.

### 🔹 2. Inheritance
- **Employee → Developer** — demonstrates subclassing and method overriding.

### 🔹 3. Data Structures in Classes
- **ToDoList** — uses a list of dictionaries for task management.
- **BankSystem** — manages multiple customer accounts in a list.
- **VotingSystem** — stores votes in a dictionary and determines a winner.
- **UniqueNumbers** — uses a set to ensure no duplicates.
- **ContactManager** — manages unique names alphabetically using a set.
- **Matrix** — adds two 2×2 matrices.
- **DataAnalyzer** — computes min, max, mean, and median from a list.

## 🧩 Key Concepts Demonstrated
| Concept | Example |
|----------|----------|
| Class creation | `class BankAccount:` |
| Object instantiation | `acc = BankAccount("Alice", 1000)` |
| Inheritance | `class Developer(Employee):` |
| Data encapsulation | Using dictionaries and sets inside classes and their methods|
| Method overriding | Customizing inherited methods |
| Data handling | Using `list`, `dict`, `set`, and `tuple` |

Would you like me to make it more **exam-style**, with short task instructions and no example code (for student submissions)?
